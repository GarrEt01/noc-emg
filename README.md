# NOC As A Service 

This is an overview on how the NOC handles “Help Desk Calls”, VDI restarts, ECL Watch account password resets, and our typical process and guidelines.



## Process

The NOC is responsible for managing all Service Line (HelpDesk) over-flow calls, after-hours calls, and holiday calls, as the Service Line works specific hours. The NOC also handles ECL Watch account password resets, 24x7x365, VDI (Virtual Machines) resets, and specific domain account unlocks which include, but are not limited to: PUB, PCI, NOAM, etc.
