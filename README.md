# NOC As A Service 

This service is an overview of processes and policies the NOC (Network Operations Center) team may offer and aim to adhere to.



## Process

The NOC is the central communication center for technical engagement and support, with an in-depth and continuously expanding understanding of team placements, roles, and contact information. The NOC receives thousands of emails a week, including but not limited to: HelpDesk overflow calls, ECL account support, company group-wide severity communication notices, escalations, updates, company-wide bridge line calls, server monitoring and data center hands-on support.


## Feature Requests
The NOC is quick to adapt to new features, as we continue to expand technical and modern business knowledge, to remain engaged and current in the world of technology with company provided learning opportunities. The NOC is appreciative of opportunities to assist with hands-on learning, beyond their own training material.
